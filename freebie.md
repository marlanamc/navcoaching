## Concept: "Your Personal ADHD Structure Roadmap"

  Here's what I'm thinking:

  The Flow:

  1. Someone takes your quiz â†’ gets their archetype
  2. Opt-in for their "Personal Structure Roadmap" (email required)
  3. They get a customized PDF guide based on their quiz results

  The Guide Contents:

  For each archetype (Light/Moderate/Intensive), include:
  - What This Means: Why you need this level of structure
  - Your Biggest Challenges: Common roadblocks for your type
  - 5 Strategies That Work: Specific to your structure needs
  - Red Flags to Avoid: What NOT to try (like time blocking for freedom-lovers)
  - Next Steps: How coaching would be customized for your type

  Questions:

  1. What are your quiz archetypes called? (so I can create the right categories)
  2. Do you want to create this as:
    - Simple web pages with email gates?
    - Actual PDF downloads?
    - Email course series?
  3. What's your biggest insight about different structure needs? (your core framework)
