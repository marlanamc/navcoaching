# Navigating the Storm – Community Model Website Update Plan

## Core Shift
We are moving from a **1:1 session-first business** to a **community-first membership model** with optional 1:1 add-ons.  
The main value is ongoing accountability, body doubling, group calls, and structured nudges — **not** just private calls.

---

## Website Structure Updates

### Hero Section
- Focus on **community, connection, and momentum**.
- Replace "Book Now" primary button with "Join the Crew".
- Add secondary button for "Private Coaching Add-Ons".

---

### Membership Tiers (Monthly)
**All tiers include:**
- Access to body doubling sessions (camera optional or mandatory depending on session)
- Weekly Sunday Compass Call
- Access to Discord community:
  - #daily-anchor-and-compass channel
  - #resources-and-discussion
  - #weekly-wins-starlight
  - #body-doubling-links
  - #general chat

- Monthly resource roundup

### Messaging Tone

## Launch Notes

- Priority: Fill **Harbor Pass** and **Captain’s Circle** tiers first to create community energy
- Private calls can be upsold once members see the value of group + text support
