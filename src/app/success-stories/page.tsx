      "Implemented weekly priority-setting sessions",
      "Created project \"containers\" to prevent scope creep",

      "Established \"client containers\" with clear boundaries",

      "Developed sustainable work rhythm without burning out creativity"
    ],
    quote: "I was skeptical about adding 'structure' to my creative process, but Marlie helped me find systems that support my creativity instead of stifling it.",
    outcome: "Sam now has a waitlist of clients and has raised their rates twice, with the confidence and systems to deliver consistently excellent work."
