### **⚓️ Structure vs. Freedom Self Quiz –** 

I want to add this quiz to my website as a freebie to get people's emails for a newsletter sign up. I also want this for my clients to take so I can see what kind of structure they need. Maybe it could be called "What type of ADHD coaching do you need?"  i want each question to show up one by one and maybe as a sliding structure 1-3 for quick answers. Also show them a progress tracker on top so they can see how many questions. 

This quiz helps identify how a client *responds to different types of structure* — not by asking if they “like routines,” but by measuring their **emotional and functional relationship** to five categories of structure. Each question maps to a system type, and the client’s responses shape their **structure archetype** and coaching strategy.
